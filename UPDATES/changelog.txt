2.0.4 - (RC4) 
      - Autoupdater implemented.
      - Bugs fixed: view all scripts, marking as sent (emailing), PBS autoupdates (unzipping)
      - New features: edit date of scripts and directions (temporary changes until next search), search for marked owings (dispense with "//" in directions).
3.0.0 - (Alpha) [iRxReq]
      - iPharmacy version. This version no longer supports FRED. DO NOT UPDATE IF YOU STILL USE FRED AS YOUR MAIN DISPENSE. Update will prevent use of this software.
      - DO NOT SELF UPGRADE - this upgrade requires several new files to be manually installed.
      - All previous scripts from the FRED version will no longer exist. Doctors can be converted to the new system with help from Luke in Launceston HPS. DO NOT UPGRADE UNTIL THIS IS DONE.
3.0.1 - (RC1)
      - Fixed bug which prevented import of any new scripts.
      - Fixed bug causing emails to fail to send and mark as sent.
      - Script requests can now be emailed in bulk! Now when in the Script View screen, clicking email script will email each doctor (who has the setting switched on) their requests.
      - Doctors can now be marked with the frequency Never, which will exclude them from normal reports (unless you untick weekly and fortnightly).
      - Windows now will correctly come to the foreground when you close the child window.
      - Updater made compatible with iRxReq.
      - Several reports added/altered:
         * You can now run a report for Medical Records
         * You can now run a simple report for easier finding of scripts
         * You can now select whether you want a letter with the report at the time of printing rather than searching
      - Doctors names now shouldn't get cut off (up to a maximum of 50 characters)
      - You can still find specially marked owings with this version. Dispense with "//" in the directions as usual. The button has moved down the the bottom of the report window.
      - New setting Store Code added.
         *If you get an error starting up RxReq, press ignore and go to the settings tab and enter your Store Code (the code that prefixes URs for non-hospital patients, e.g. LA)
3.0.2 - (RC2)
      - Fixed bug which caused errors when closing windows
3.0.3 - (RC3)
      - Partially fixed bug which caused error on printing some reports. Can still press "ignore" to print reports with no consequences. To investigate further.
      - Fixed bug which caused users to be prompted to overwrite old note when changing the note box in the reporting screen.
3.1.X - [iRxReq v1.X]
      - Print onto PBS stationary
      - Calculated authority numbers
3.2.0 - [iRxReq v2.0]
      - Various bug fixes
      - Names now should come out correctly. No more incorrect surnames and first names. May still have issues with Double Barrell surnames (e.g. "Van Winden" etc). These have to be programmed as a known pattern.
      - User login is now implemented.
          * Non-admin users will not need to use a password
          * Admin users will need to create a password the first time they are activated
          * The first user to run this version will be assigned as admin
          * Now only admins can wipe the database files
          * More features linked to user accounts will be released in the future (e.g. send logs will have the user who was logged in)
      - Import time is now SIGNIFICANTLY quicker, and now should be almost instantaneous (depending on the database size)
      - PBS scripts should now print for doctors who have the email setting on (they will also be emailed in the next version).
      - Authority scripts without a streamline now will leave the date blank on PBS scripts, so the doctor can fill it out
      - No more funny symbols in drug names and medication directions!
3.2.1 - [iRxReq v2.1]
      - Several bug fixes
      - UR numbers now print on PBS scripts
      - Doctors can now opt-in to print onto PBS stationary by default.
          * Opted in doctors will no longer print out the summary. Notes associated with the script will be printed on the PBS script on the "Doctor Copy" section.
          * iRxReq will warn you how many pages per doctor you need to get ready when printing
          * Doctors who are emailed their reports will receive a copy of the PBS script automatically along with the normal summart
      - Authority status is now shown within the script edit screen. You can remove the authority status from a script which will delete the streamline and "authority note" on the summary.
      - You can now remove the "PBS-Status" of a script to make the item "NON-PBS".
          * This causes the PBS code of the drug to be forgotten. If you wish to revert to PBS again you will need to supply the relevant PBS code.
      - S8 and S4D/S11 scripts are now automatically marked as such when the script is viewed for the first time.
          * This implementation is not perfect and may miss some medications, and mark some when they should not.
          * You can manually change the category of the script
          * S8s and S11s currently print with "handwritten" prompts. Will investigate whether to remove for S4D/S11 scripts.
      - Removed some unnecessary parts of NON-Authority scripts on the PBS stationary. Further cleaning of this form to follow in future versions
      - Login system is extended.
          * Admins must now enter a password to delete data from the databases.
          * The user who sent a request is now logged in the "Audit Log" in the script view screen.
          * Non-admins can no longer edit store settings.
3.2.2 - [iRxReq v2.2]
      - Various bug fixes
          * Fixed an exploit where users could mark themselves as an admin using an external database editor.
      - You can now mark a prescription as owing or not owing when editing in the Script View screen
          * This can be useful as an alternative to the "excluding" tag already available, however it will be overwritten on the next import from iPharmacy
      - Patient encryption added
          * Existing patients will no longer be able to be viewed. There is now way to fix this as it is an overhaul on the way patients are stored in the database
          * Existing patients who have owing script will be updated to the new format on the next import. This should fix all owing scripts.
          * Patient names, addresses and medicare numbers are now encrypted
3.2.3 - [iRxReq v2.3]
      - Various bug fixes
          * Hopefully fixed patient address showing ">" symbols
      - You can now edit the text that is shown at the top of the prescription request summary
          * Admin accounts can edit this from the settings screen. Limited formatting options are available.
          * The pharmacy name can be displayed with "<STORE>" while the hospital name can be displayed with "<CLIENT>".
      - The hospital name should now print dynamically in the report. This can be added to a custom letter using the placeholder "<CLIENT>".
      - You can now set a start date (or "go-live" date) for your site. This is available to admin users in the settings tab. Reports will not search information older than this
          * This is useful for sites that have scripts in iPharmacy from before the go-live date (e.g. another site looks after the scripts before that date and they should be excluded).
