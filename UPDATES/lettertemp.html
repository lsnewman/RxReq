<P>We have attached a list of prescriptions we require which were provided by &lt;BRANCH&gt; to patients at &lt;CLIENT&gt;. These items were supplied as PBS supplies on the proviso that we would receive the PBS copies of the medication chart.</P>
<P>All the following scripts are for items which we never received the chart from the ward. There can be many reasons for this:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Variable dose medications (e.g. Warfarin or Prednisolone)</LI>
<LI>Multiple Supplies (e.g. for inpatient, and then again on discharge)</LI>
<LI>Phone orders or STAT orders</LI>
<LI>Authorities (streamline and/or phone authority)</LI></UL>
<P>All of the above items may not be covered by the standard chart for PBS supply, and therefore from time to time we may have to request additional prescriptions from the prescriber.</P>
<P>We try to send as little requests through to our prescriber as possible, however in some cases there may be a list we require.</P>
